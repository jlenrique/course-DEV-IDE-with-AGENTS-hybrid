"""Cross-field validators for `OperatorVerdict` (FR31 + FR34 tamper-evidence).

Two invariants live here as standalone testable functions:

1. `enforce_no_tamper_verbs` — the second of the triple-layer red-rejection
   for the FR34 tamper-evidence guarantee. Even though the `Literal[
   "approve", "edit", "reject"]` field type makes tamper verbs unconstructible
   via the normal path, this re-check fires on `validate_assignment=True`
   mutations and on any future code path that bypasses the `Literal` (e.g.,
   `model_construct` for raw dict ingest). The schema-pin test is the third
   layer.

2. `enforce_verb_payload_consistency` — `verb == "edit"` REQUIRES `edit_payload`
   non-None; `verb == "reject"` REQUIRES `reject_reason` non-None; conversely,
   ``approve`` with either field set is rejected as a likely typo.
